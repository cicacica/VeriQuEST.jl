  abstract  = {Delegating difficult computations to remote large computation facilities, with appropriate security guarantees, is a possible solution for the ever-growing needs of personal computing power. For delegated computation protocols to be usable in a larger context -- or simply to securely run two protocols in parallel -- the security definitions need to be composable. Here, we define composable security for delegated quantum computation. We distinguish between protocols which provide only blindness -- the computation is hidden from the server -- and those that are also verifiable -- the client can check that it has received the correct result. We show that the composable security definition capturing both these notions can be reduced to a combination of several distinct ``trace/distance/type'' criteria -- which are, individually, non/composable security definitions.},
